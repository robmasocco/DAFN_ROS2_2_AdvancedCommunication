% --- Services Limitations ---
\begin{frame}{Services Limitations}
The third paradigm exists because services implementation relies on the following \textbg{restrictive assumptions}.
\begin{alertblock}{Services Implementation Assumptions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Since the client may block for the entire duration of the request processing, \textbr{server computations should be short and always produce some result} (e.g. even an error must be a result).
    \item Service calls are finished only when the response has been received, i.e. \textbr{if either the client or the server crash, the behaviour of the other one is undefined} (say hello to deadlocks, crashes...).
    \item Once a service is called, \textbr{the request may never be interrupted}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
These make \textbg{processes} that \textbg{must be requested} and \textbg{take a long time} (for CPUs!) completely unfeasible.\\
Think of practically-interesting stuff such as \textbg{movement}, \textbg{navigation}...

% --- ROS 2 Actions ---
\begin{frame}{ROS 2 Actions}
Built on services and message topics, they \textbg{decouple computations from middleware tasks}, thanks to the concepts of \textbg{goal}, \textbg{feedback} and \textbg{result}.\\
Their implementation is still a bit cumbersome, but are \textbg{extensively used for robot navigation and movement}.

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{ROS 2 Actions}
In actual ROS 2 applications, the \textbg{client} requests the completion of some \textbg{goal} to the \textbg{server}. The middleware only offers APIs to \textbg{notify the state of the goal} between the two.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The \textbg{client} sends a \textbg{goal service request} to the server.
  \item The \textbg{server} may \textbg{accept} or \textbg{reject} the goal request.
  \item Server computations, if any, are usually started when the goal is \textbg{executed}: the middleware only updates the state of the goal, the rest is up to the developer.
  \item The \textbg{client may cancel} the goal request; the \textbg{server may abort} the goal request; intermediate results and information, if any, are published by the server on the \textbg{feedback topic}.
  \item The \textbg{server} sends a \textbg{result service request} to the client, to transmit the final result.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

% --- Coding Action Servers and Clients ---
\begin{frame}{Coding Action Servers and Clients}
\begin{block}{Servers}
Goal requests are handled with \textbf{callbacks}, while computations can be handled freely (usually in separate threads). When done, the goal must be marked as \textbf{succeeded} or \textbf{aborted}, which triggers another callback to contact the client's result service.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Clients}
Similarly to services, much is done with \textbf{\texttt{future} objects}. Cancellation request code can be placed almost everywhere and activated asynchronously.
\end{block}
Handling all possible scenarios for a goal results in the \textbg{longest and most complicated code that a ROS 2 application may ever require}. {\Large\smiley{}}

% --- Interface Files - Actions ---
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Interface Files - Actions}
Combine \textbg{three messages} in a single interface file, separated by \texttt{-{}-{}-}.\\
Action file names end with \texttt{.action}.\\
There are no example packages for actions as of today.
